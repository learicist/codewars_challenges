/*Description:
Given an array (arr) as an argument complete the function countSmileys that should return the total number of smiling faces.

Rules for a smiling face:
-Each smiley face must contain a valid pair of eyes. Eyes can be marked as : or ;
-A smiley face can have a nose but it does not have to. Valid characters for a nose are - or ~
-Every smiling face must have a smiling mouth that should be marked with either ) or D.
No additional characters are allowed except for those mentioned.
Valid smiley face examples:
:) :D ;-D :~)
Invalid smiley faces:
;( :> :} :] 
*/

function countSmileys (arr) {
  
  //create a reference object with RegEx values to speed up the process
  let validFaces = {
    eyes: /[;:]/,
    nose: /[-~]/,
    mouth: /[)D]/
  }

  //test for invalid faces regardless of nose to shorten to list of options
  let temp =  arr
    .filter(a => 
      validFaces.eyes.test(a) 
      && 
      validFaces.mouth.test(a)
      &&
      a.length <= 3);
  
  //if the face has a nose, check it for validity. then return the length of the remaining candidate array
  return temp.filter(function (a) { 
    if (a.length == 3) {
       return validFaces.nose.test(a); 
    } else {
      return a;
    }
  }).length;
